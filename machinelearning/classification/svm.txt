Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- understand patterns within the data
- SVM is a supervised algorithm that classifies cases by finding a separator
1. Mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space
2. Finding a separator

Data transformation
Mapping data in a higher dimensional space is called "Kernelling"
Kernelling function:
- Linear
- Polynomial
- RBF
- Sigmoid

Using SVM to find the hyperplane 
- A linear line that seperates color1 points from another color2 points in a graph
- Support vectors help achieve the goal

Pros and cons of SVM
- Advantages:
    - Accurate in high-dimensional spaces
    - Memory efficient

Disadvantages: 
    - Prone to over-fitting
    - No probability estimation
    - small datasets

Applications:
    - Image recognition
    - Text category assignment
    - Detecting spam
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Gene expression classifaction 
    - regression, outlier detection, and clustering
