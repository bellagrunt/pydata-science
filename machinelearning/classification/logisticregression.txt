Logistic Regression
- might try to predict a continuous value of variables such as the price of a 
house, blood pressure of a patient, or fuel consumption of a car. 
- But in logistic regression, we predict a variable which is binary such as 
yes/no, true/false, successful or not successful, pregnant/not pregnant, and 
so on, all of which can be coded as zero or one.
- yes or no
- 0 or 1 

What is logistic regression?
- a classification alforithm for categorical variables

Churn 
- Dependent variable 

Applications:
- Predicting the probability of a person having a heart attack
- Predicting the mortality in injured patients 
- Predicting a customers propensity to purchase a product or half a subscription
- Predicting the probability of failure of a given process or product
- Predicting the likelihood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage


When is logistic regression suitable?
- If your data is binary
    - 0/1, yes/no, true/false
- if you need the probability results
- when you need a linear decision boundary
- if you need to understand the impact of a feature

Logistic regression vs linear regression

Predicting churn using linear regression 
- theta is a vector of parameters 
- linear regression is not good for classification problems

The problem with using linear regression
- returns a number besides 0 or 1. outputs a number greater than 0 or 1

Sigmoid function in logistic regression
- logistic function

classification of the customer churn model
P(Y=1|X)
P(y=0|X) = 1 - P(y=1|x)

P(Churn=1|income,age)=0.8
P(Churn=0|income,age)=1-0.8=0.2

Training process:
1. Initialize theta vector with random values
2. Calculate y-hat = sigmoid of theta transpose x
- prediction value
3. Compare the output of y-hat with actual output of customer, y, and record 
it as error. 
4. Calculate the error for all customers
- cost function 
5. change the theta to reduce the cost
- reduce the cost
6. Go back to step 2

- Logistic Regression Training -


General cost function
- Change the weight -> reduce the cost

- Cost function

Plotting the cost function of the model
- model yhat
- actual value y=1 or 0
- if Y=1 and yhat=1 -> cost =0

Logistic regression cost function

Minimizing the cost function of the model
- How to find te best parameters for our model?
    - Minimize the cost function

- How to minimize the cost function?
    - Using gradient descent

- What is gradient descent?
    - A technique to use the derivative of a cost function to change the parameter
    values, in order to minimize the cost
