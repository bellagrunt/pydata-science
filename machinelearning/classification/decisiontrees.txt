Decision Trees
- Decision trees are built by splitting the training set into distinct nodes,
where one node contains all of or most of one category of the data.
- Each internal node corresponds to a test
- Each branch corresponds to a result of the test
- Each leaf node assigns a classification


Decision tree learning algorithm
1. Choose an attribute from your dataset
2. Calculate the significance of attribute in splitting of data.
3. Split data based on the value of the best attribute
4. Go to step 1.

Building Decision Trees
- Decision trees are built using recursive partitioning to classify the data.

Entropy 
- Measure of randomness or uncertainty
- Lower the Entropy, the less uniformm the distribution, the purer the node
