Non-Linear Regression 
- to model non-lenear relationship between the dependent variable and a set of
independent variables
- y-hat must be a non-linear function of the parameters theta, not necessarily the
futures x


What is polynomial regression?
- Some curvy data can be modeled by a polynomial regression
- a polynomial regression model can be transformed into Linear
regression model
