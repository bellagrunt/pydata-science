Regression


What is regression?
- process of predicting a continuous value

Two type of variables 
1. Y: Dependent variable
- final goal

2. X: Independent variable 
- causes of the final goal

Two types of Regression model
1. Simple Regression:
    - Simple Linear Regression
    - Simple non-linear regression
    ex: 
    Predict co2 emission vs engine size of all cars

2. Multiple Regression:
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Multiple non-linear regression
    ex: 
    Predict co2 emission vs engine size and cylinders of all cars


Applications of regression
- sale forecasting
- satisfaction analysis 
- price estimation
- employment income

Regression algorithms 
- Ordinal regression
- poisson regression
- fast forest quantile regression
- linear, polynomial, lasso, stepwise, ridge regression
- bayesian linear regression
- neural network regression
- decision forest regression
- boosted decision tree regression
- KNN (K-nearest neighbors)

Simple Linear Regression

- using linear regression to predict continuous values

- Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the 
relationship between two or more variables. 

- In simple linear regression, there are two variables, a dependent variable and 
an independent variable. 

- The key point in the linear regression is that our dependent value should be 
continuous and cannot be a discrete value.



Two types of linear regression models
1. Simple linear regression 
    - Predict co2emission vs engineSize of all cars
        - Independent variable (x): engineSize
        - Dependent variable (y): co2emission

2. Multiple linear regression
    - Predict co2 emission vs engine size and cylinders of all cars
        - Independent variable (x): engineSize, cylinders, etc
        - Dependent variable (y): co2emission


Linear regression model representation:
y = O0+O1x1
y hat = Theta zero plus Theta one X one
y hat is the response variable

x1 = 2.4 independent variable
y = 250 actual co2 emission of x1 

Linear regression estimates the coefficients of the line. This means we must 
calculate theta 0 and theta 1 to find the best line to fit the data. This line
would best estimate the emission of the unknown data points. Let's see how we 
can find this line or, to be more precise, how we can adjust the parameters to 
make the line the best fit for the data.

Model Evaluation in regression models 

Model evaluation approaches
- train and test on the same dataset
- train/test split

Regression Evaluation metrics


What is training and out of sample accuracy?
- Training accuracy
    - % of correct preditions that the model makes when using the test dataset
    - high training accuracy isn't necessarily a good thing
    - result of over-fitting
        - over-fit: the model is overly trained to the dataset, which may capture
        noise and produce a non-generalized model

- out of sample accuracy
    - models have a high out of sample accuracy
    - train / test / split

Validation between test / training 
-- k-fold cross validation
- using the same dataset where each split is different


--------------------------------------------------------------



Evaluation Metrics in regression models
- regression accuracy
- compare actual and predicted values to calculate the accuracy of a regression 
model
- Evaluation metrics, provide a key role in the development of a model, as it 
provides insight to areas that require improvement.


What is an error of the model?
- error: measure of how far the data is from the fitted regression line

Multiple Linear Regression


Two types of linear regression models
1. Simple linear regression 
    - Predict co2emission vs engineSize of all cars
        - Independent variable (x): engineSize
        - Dependent variable (y): co2emission

2. Multiple linear regression
    - Predict co2emission vs enginesize and cylinders of all cars
        - Independent variable (x): engineSize, cylinders, etc
        - Dependent variable (y): co2emission


1. First, it can be used when it would like to identify the strength of the 
effect that the independent variables have on the dependent variable.

2. Second, it can be used to predict the impact of changes, that is, to 
understand how the dependent variable changes when we change the independent 
variables.

Examples of Multiple linear regression
- independent variables effectiveness on prediction
    - does revision time, test anxiety, lecture attendance and gender have any
    effect on the exam performance of students?

- Predicint impacts of change
    - How does blood pressure go up or down for every unit increase or decrease
    in the BMI of a patient?


Estimating Multiple linear regression parameters
    How to estimate theta?
        - Ordinary least squares
            - Linear algebra operations
            - takes a long time for large datasets (10k+rows)

        - An optimization algorithm
            - Gradient descent
            - Proper approach if you have a very large dataset

Note - use limited variables or many variables for prediction
