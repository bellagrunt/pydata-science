Hierarchical clustering
- algorithms build a hierarchy of clusters where each node is a cluster consists 
of the clusters of its daughter nodes
- can be slow for large datasets
- does not require the number of clusters to run
- gives more than one partitioning depending on the resolution
- always generates the same clusters

Two types:
    Agglomerative:
        - bottom up
        - each clusters are built up 
        - collect things
        - more popular

    Divisive:
        - top down 
        - break it down into smaller pieces


Agglomerative clustering
    - Dendrogram
    - bottom up approach

    Steps:
        1. Create n clusters, one for each data point
        2. Compute the proximity matrix
        3. Repeat
            i. merge the two closest clusters
            ii. update the proximity matrix
        4. Until only a single cluster remains


Distance between clusters 
- Single-linkage clustering
    - minimum distance between clusters

- complete-linkage clustering
    - maximum distance between clusters

- average linkage clustering
    - average distance between clusters

- centroid linkage clustering
    - distance between cluster centroids


Advantages:
- doesnt require number of clusters to be specified
- easy to implement 
- produces a dendrogram, which helps with understanding the data

Disadvantages:
- can never undo any previous steps throughout the algorithm
- generally has long runtimes
- sometimes difficult to identify the number of clusters by the dendrogram
