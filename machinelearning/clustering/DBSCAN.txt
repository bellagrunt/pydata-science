DBSCAN clustering
    - Density based clustering
    - spherical-shape clusters
    - arbitrary-shape clusters
    - clusters inside clusters

K-means vs DBSCAN
k-means: assigns all points to a cluster even if they don't belong in any
DBSCAN: locates regions of high density and separates outliers

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
    - is one of the most common clustering algorithms
    - works based on density of objects

R(radius of neighborhood)
    - Radius (R) that if includes enough number of points within, we call it a
    dense area

M(Min number of neighbors)
    - The minimum number of data points we want in a neighborhood to define a
    cluster
