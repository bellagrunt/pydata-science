K-means clustering
- group only unsupervised
- Partitioning
- divides the data into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) without any
cluser-internal structure.
- examples within a cluser are very similar
- examples across different clusers are very different


1. K-means clustering - initialize K
Initialize k=3
centroids randomly

2, K-means clustering - calculate the distance
Distance calculation

3. K-means clustering - assign to centroid
Assign each point to the closest centroid

4. K-means clustering - compute new centroids
Compute the new centroids for each cluster

5. k-means clustering - repeat
Repeat until there are no more changes

----------------------------------------------------

K-means clustering algorithm
1. Randomly placing k centroids, one for each cluster
2. Calculate the distance of each point from each centroid
3. Assign each data point (object) to its closest centroid, creating a cluster
4. Recalculate the position of the k centroids
5. Repeat the steps 2-4, until the centroids no longer move. 

K-means accuracy
- External approach
    - compare the clusters with the ground truth, if its available

- Internal approach
    - average the distance between data points within a cluster
