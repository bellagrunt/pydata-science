Clustering
- finding points in a dataset unsupervised
- group of objects that are similar to other objects in the cluster, and 
dissimilar to data points in other clusters.

Clustering for segmentation
- analyyical approach to deriving segments and groups from large datasets
- group data unsupervised

Clustering vs classification

Classification:
- labeled dataset - structured data > modeling -> decision tree
- Supervised data

Clustering:
unlabeld dataset - unstructured data > modeling -> K-means
- Unsupervised data


Applications
    Retail/Marketing:
        - Id buying patterns of customers
        - recommending new books or movies to new customers
    
    Banking:
        - Fraud detection in credit card use
        - id clusters of customers (loyal)
    
    Insurance: 
        - Fraud detection in claims analysis
        - Insurance risk of customers
    
    Publication:
        - Auto-categorizing news based on their content
        - Recommending similar news articles

    Medicine: 
        - Characterizing patient behavior

    Biology:
        - Clustering genetic markers to id family ties

    
Why?
    - Exploratory data analysis
    - Summary generation
    - Outlier detection
    - Finding duplicates
    - Pre-processing step


Clustering algorithms
    Partitioned-based Clustering:
        - Relatively efficient
        - K-means, K-median, Fuzzy c-means
    
    Hierarchical Clustering:
        - Produces trees of clusters
        - Agglomerative, Divisive

    Density-based Clustering:
        - Produces arbitrary shaped clusters
        - space clusters
        - DBSCAN
