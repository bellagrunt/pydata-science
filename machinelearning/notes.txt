ML to make predictions

0. Get data
1. clean data
2. select proper algorithm for building prediction model
3. train model to understand patterns in data

- Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be
used to predict your new or unknown

What is machine learning?
    - the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn
    without being explicitly programmed - Arthur Samuel"

    - Data > feature extraction > a machine learning model > output

Major ML techniques:
- Regression / Estimation 
    - Predicting continous values

- classification
    - predicting the item class / category of a case

- clustering
    - finding the structure of data, summarization

- associations
    - associating frequent co-occuring items / events

- Anomaly detection
    - discovering adnormal and unusual cases

- Sequence mining
    - Predicting next events; click-steam (Markov model, HMM)

- Dimension Reduction
    - Reducing the size of data (PCA)

- Recommendation Systems
    - Recommending items


Difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning?

AI components:
    - computer vision
    - language processing
    - creativity

ML components:
    - classification

- Python for Machine learning -

Libraries: 
1. numpy - math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python

2. scipy -  collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, 
including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more

3. matplotlib - plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting

4. Pandas - is a very high-level Python library that provides high
performance easy to use data structures. It has many functions for data 
importing, manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures 
and operations for manipulating numerical tables and timeseries. 

5. scikitLearn - has most of the classification, regression and clustering
algorithms, and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific
libraries; NumPy and SciPy.
- cikit Learn including pre-processing of data, feature selection, 
feature extraction, train test splitting, defining the algorithms,
fitting models, tuning parameters, prediction, evaluation and exporting the 
model

Example: 
from sklearn import preprocessing
X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X)

from sklearn.model_selection import tran_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)

from sklearn import svm
clf = svm.SVC((gamma=o.001, C=100))

clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
clf.predit(X_test)

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, yhat, label=[1,0]))

import pickle
s = pickle.dumps(clf)

Supervised vs unsupervised

What is supervised learning?
-  observe, and direct the execution of a task, project, or activity
- teach the model by loading with knowledge (data) to predict
- teach the model by training it with some data from a labeled dataset

Two types of supervised learning
1. classification
    - the process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
2. regression
    - process of predicting continuous values


what is unsupervised learning?
- model works on its own to discover info
- trains on the dataset, and draws conclusions on unlabeled data. 
- unsupervised learning has more difficult algorithms than supervised 
learning since we know little to no information about the data, or the 
outcomes that are to be expected

Techniques: 
- Dimension Reduction
- Density Estimation
- Market basket analysis
- clustering
    - grouping of data points or objects that somehow similar by:
        1. discovering structure
        2. summarization
        3. Anomaly detection
