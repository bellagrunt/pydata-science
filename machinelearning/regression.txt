Regression


What is regression?
- process of predicting a continuous value

Two type of variables 
1. Y: Dependent variable
- final goal

2. X: Independent variable 
- causes of the final goal

Two types of Regression model
1. Simple Regression:
    - Simple Linear Regression
    - Simple non-linear regression
    ex: 
    Predict co2 emission vs engine size of all cars

2. Multiple Regression:
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Multiple non-linear regression
    ex: 
    Predict co2 emission vs engine size and cylinders of all cars


Applications of regression

- satisfaction analysis 
- price estimation
- employment income

Regression algorithms
