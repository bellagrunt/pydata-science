Model Development
- A model can be thought of as a math equation used to predict
a value given one or more other variables
- relating one or more independent variables to dependent variables.
- usually the more relevant data you have, the more accurate your model is 

Example:
1. you ave two almost identical cars
2. pink cars sell for less
3. one pink / one red
4. if you don't put in the color variable then the two cars will sell the same.
