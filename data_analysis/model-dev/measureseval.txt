Measures for In-Sample Evaluation

- a way to numerically determine how good the model fits on dataset
- two important measures to determine the fit of a model:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - R-Squared(R^2)

In python measure the MSE:
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mean_squared_error(df['price'],Y_predict_simple_fit)

R-Squared / R^2
- the coefficient of determination or R Squared
- a measture to determine how close the data is to the fitted regression line
- R^2 : the percentage of variation of the target variable (Y) that is explaied by the linear model
- such as, compare a regression model to a simple model i.e the mean of the data points
