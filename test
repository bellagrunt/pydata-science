In this assignment, you will analyse and predict housing prices using attributes
or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so 
on. A templet notebook is provided in the lab; your job is to complete the ten 
questions. Some hints to the questions are given in the templet notebook in the 
next . You will use Watson Studios to do the analysis, this will allow you to 
share  an image of your Jupyter notebook with a URL

Review criterialess 
There are ten questions. Simple questions are worth one mark, and harder 
questions are worth two marks. For each item, you should take a screen shot of 
the output of each cell with the code that generated it. The provided code must 
be run. Most of the questions are independent i.e. if you miss one you can still 
do the rest of the problems. You will also be asked to share your notebook. You 
will also receive marks for displaying you notebook.
