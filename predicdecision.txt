Predition and Decision Making:

Decision making: 
- determining a good model fit 
- to determine best fit: 
    - do the predited values make sense
    - visualization
    - numerical measures for evaluation
    - comparing models

Do the predicted values make sense:
- First train the model :
1. lm.fit(df['highway-mpg'], df['prices'])
2. Preixt the price of a car with 30 highway-mpg
lm.predict(30)
3. result:
lm.coef
