# sets
# type of collection
# - like lists and tuples you can input different
# python types
# unlike lists and tuples they are unordered
# - sets do not record element position
# Sets only have unique elements
# - there is only one particular element in a set
# Typecasting: set()

# set1 = {"pop", "funk", "rock"}

# album_list = ["Coolio", "Thriller", "Thriller", 1971]
# album_set = set(album_list)
# print(album_set)

# set operations
# A = {"Thriller", "Back in Red", "311"}
# A.add("Mayhem")
# print(A)
